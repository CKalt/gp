Fist goal is to create a rust version of gp that solves the
ant problem as I have it currently working with my gp.c project.

This is strictly a first iteration expecting many more.

I will try to make this very simple. For example this version
will be a single thread, and I will try not to get too hung up 
on best modeling details leveraging all of rust features.

That will all be put off to future iterations.
